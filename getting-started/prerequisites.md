# Prerequisites

Before you start building or integrating an MCP Server, ensure your development environment and your team are ready with the following tools, knowledge, and setup.

---

## 🧠 Technical Knowledge

You should be familiar with:

- **Basic API development**
  - RESTful design, request/response cycles, HTTP verbs
- **Working with JSON**
  - Input/output in MCP is always JSON-based
- **Server-side development**
  - Experience in backend frameworks (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
- **Event-driven or RPC-like communication** *(optional but helpful)*

---

## 💻 Development Tools

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [ ] A modern **code editor** like VS Code
- [ ] **Git** for version control
- [ ] **Node.js** (for JavaScript/TypeScript SDK) or **Python 3.8+** (for Python SDK)
- [ ] [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) *(optional)* for running MCP client locally
- [ ] [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or **cURL** for testing endpoints

## 📦 Recommended SDKs

Depending on your preferred language, install the appropriate SDK:

### ➤ For Node.js/TypeScript

```bash
npm install @mcp/sdk
```

---

## ➤ For Python

```bash
pip install mcp-sdk
```

---

You can find more SDKs at: [github.com/modelcontextprotocol](github.com/modelcontextprotocol)

---

## 🔐 API & Data Access

Make sure you have:

- ✅ Access to the internal systems (databases, services, APIs) you want to expose
- ✅ API keys or credentials configured (if needed)
- ✅ Read-only or scoped access for safe integration

---

## 🏗️ System Requirements

- Operating System: macOS, Linux, or WSL for Windows
- Memory: At least 4 GB RAM
- Disk Space: 500 MB+ (depends on Docker image size and logs)

---

## 📚 Documentation to Review

- [Introduction to MCP](./what-is-mcp.md)
- [MCP Components](../architecture/components.md)
- [Data Flow](../architecture/data-flow.md)

These will help you understand the architecture and reasoning behind the protocol.
