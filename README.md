# 📘 MCP Server Documentation

This repository contains complete developer documentation for building, running, and integrating **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Servers** — a powerful way to connect AI models (like Claude or GPT) with real-time data, tools, and business logic.

---

## 🔍 What is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard that allows large language models (LLMs) to request and consume real-time context from external systems securely via defined **capabilities**. MCP Servers act as the backend interface that exposes those capabilities.

> Think of it as an API bridge between your AI model and your systems — clean, secure, and AI-friendly.
