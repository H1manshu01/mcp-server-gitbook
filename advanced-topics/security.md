# Security Best Practices for MCP Servers

MCP Servers are a gateway between your internal systems and AI models. That makes them **high-value targets** for misuse or data leakage if not secured properly.

This guide outlines the key areas you should secure when building and deploying your MCP server.

---

## 🔐 Why Security Matters

- MCP servers can access internal tools, databases, and services.
- Poorly designed capabilities may leak sensitive data.
- AI models are powerful — but also unpredictable and prone to “hallucinations.”
- Everything exposed via MCP should follow **zero-trust** principles.

## ✅ Security Checklist

| Area                     | Best Practice                                |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Capability Access        | Only expose what’s strictly necessary        |
| Input Validation         | Validate and sanitize all incoming data      |
| Output Filtering         | Avoid returning sensitive fields             |
| Authentication           | Restrict access to authorized clients        |
| Logging                  | Mask sensitive fields in logs                |
| Rate Limiting            | Prevent abuse and brute-force attacks        |
| Secrets Management       | Use env vars or vaults, never hardcode       |
| Error Handling           | Avoid verbose errors or stack traces         |

## 🚫 Limit Capability Scope

Only register the capabilities needed by the AI — no “admin-level” access unless explicitly required.

**Bad Example:**

```python
@capability()
def run_shell_command(input):
    os.system(input['command'])  # 🚨 Huge risk!
```

---

**Good Example:**

```python
@capability()
def get_order_status(input):
    # Hardcoded logic with validation
```

---

## 🧼 Input Validation & Sanitization

Use schema validators like zod (TypeScript) or pydantic/jsonschema (Python) to enforce strict input types.

**Example in TypeScript:**

```ts
input: z.object({
  orderId: z.string().min(5)
})
```

---

## 🔑 Authentication & Authorization

**🛡️ Implement Token-Based Access:**

Require API keys or bearer tokens for any client talking to your MCP server.

**🧠 Role-Based Capabilities (Optional):**

Limit certain capabilities to specific users or model contexts.

---

## 📉 Avoid Leaking Sensitive Data

**Mask confidential fields:**

```ts
const sanitized = {
  ...user,
  password: undefined,
  ssn: "****-****"
}
```

**Never include:**

- Raw passwords or tokens
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- Internal infrastructure info

---

## ⚙️ Rate Limiting & Abuse Protection

- Use middleware (like express-rate-limit in Node.js) to block flooding.
- Block repeated failed requests or malformed payloads.

---

## 🐞 Secure Error Handling

- Never return raw error traces to the model.
- Use friendly, high-level messages:
- ✅ "Failed to retrieve order. Please try again later."
- ❌ "NullPointerException at line 56 in db_utils.py"

---

## 🔐 Secrets Management

Use .env files or secret managers like:

- AWS Secrets Manager
- HashiCorp Vault
- Google Secret Manager

Example .env

```bash
DB_PASSWORD=supersecret
API_KEY=xyz123
```

Never hardcode credentials into source files.

## 📦 Recommended Libraries

| Language | Library | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python | pydantic, dotenv, ratelimit | Validation, env, throttling |
| Node.js | zod, dotenv, helmet | Validation, config, headers |
| Java | Spring Security | Auth, access control |

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Think of your MCP Server like a micro-API gateway for AI. Every capability you expose should be treated like a production endpoint.
