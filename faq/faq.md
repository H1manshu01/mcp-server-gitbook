# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This page covers common questions developers and teams have when getting started with Model Context Protocol (MCP) and building MCP servers.

---

### 💡 General

#### **Q: What is MCP in one sentence?**

**A:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard that allows AI models to interact with external systems (APIs, databases, services) through structured, secure capabilities.

#### **Q: What is an MCP Server?**

**A:** An MCP Server is a backend service that defines and exposes a set of capabilities the AI model can call during a conversation or task execution.

#### **Q: What kind of apps use MCP?**

**A:** AI assistants, chatbots, developer tools, internal support bots, and any LLM-powered agent that needs real-time, external context.

### 🛠️ Development

#### **Q: Can I run an MCP Server locally?**

**A:** Yes! You can run it just like any API server using Node.js, Python, or other supported languages. It listens on a local port and can be tested using Postman or curl.

#### **Q: Do I need a GPU to run an MCP Server?**

**A:** Nope — MCP servers are backend services. The AI model runs separately (e.g., via Claude or OpenAI APIs).

#### **Q: Is it possible to run multiple capabilities in one server?**

**A:** Yes! You can register as many capabilities as needed inside a single MCP server instance.

#### **Q: Can I reuse existing APIs in MCP capabilities?**

**A:** Absolutely. MCP servers often wrap internal APIs to provide clean, validated, model-safe access.

### 🔐 Security

#### **Q: How do I secure my MCP Server?**

**A:** Use API keys or token-based authentication, validate all inputs/outputs, and avoid exposing raw system data. Follow least-privilege principles.

#### **Q: Is rate limiting supported?**

**A:** Not by default, but you can implement rate limiting using middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit` for Node or custom decorators in Python).

---

### 🤖 LLM Integration

#### **Q: Which models support MCP natively?**

**A:** Anthropic Claude supports MCP-based tools natively. GPT and others can integrate via function-calling and a custom MCP client layer.

#### **Q: Can I simulate model interactions locally?**

**A:** Yes. Use test scripts, curl/Postman, or mock the MCP client to simulate what an AI model would trigger.

---

### 🚀 Deployment

#### **Q: Where can I deploy my MCP server?**

**A:** Anywhere you can host an API — VMs, containers, serverless platforms (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions), or traditional hosting.

#### **Q: Can I scale MCP servers horizontally?**

**A:** Yes — capabilities are stateless functions, so you can scale out using containers, Kubernetes, or cloud-based load balancers.

---

### 🧰 Troubleshooting

#### **Q: My capability isn't being called — what's wrong?**

**A:** Check:

- Capability name matches exactly
- Input schema is valid
- Server is reachable from the MCP client
- No uncaught errors in handler

#### **Q: I’m getting “invalid input” errors.**

**A:** Ensure your input matches the schema defined for the capability — types, required fields, and formats must match exactly.
