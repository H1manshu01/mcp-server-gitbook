# Common Use Cases for MCP Servers

MCP Servers open up powerful ways for AI applications to interact with your real-world systems — in a secure, structured, and maintainable way. Below are some of the most common and high-impact use cases.

---

## 📦 1. Accessing Internal Knowledge Bases

### Scenario

An AI assistant for employees needs to retrieve articles or SOPs from your internal knowledge base.

### Capability Example

```json
{
  "capability": "getArticleByTitle",
  "arguments": { "title": "Expense Reimbursement Policy" }
}
```

### Benefits

- Always up-to-date answers
- No need to train the LLM with internal docs
- Fine-grained control over content access

---

## 📊 2. Querying Business Data in Real-Time

### Scenario

A customer service bot needs to fetch order status, billing information, or shipping updates from a live database or ERP system.

### Common Capabilities

- getOrderStatus(orderId)
- getInvoiceByCustomer(customerId)
- checkInventory(sku)

### Benefits

- Fewer hallucinations
- Dynamic, reliable responses
- Custom logic stays in your system, not the model

---

## 🎯 3. Triggering Internal Workflows

### Scenario

You want an AI agent to take action — like creating a support ticket or sending a Slack message.

### Capability Examples

- createSupportTicket(subject, description)
- sendSlackAlert(channel, message)
- logUserAction(userId, action)

### Benefits

- Turns your AI from passive responder to active agent
- Keeps actions auditable and secure
- Integrates directly with existing ops tools

---

## 📅 4. Scheduling or Calendar Management

### Scenario

A smart assistant helps book meetings or check team availability.

### Capabilities

- findFreeTime(userId)
- bookMeeting(userId, timeSlot)
- getCalendarEvents(userId, dateRange)

### Benefits

- Personalized productivity tools
- Seamless user experience inside AI interfaces
- Reduces context switching

---

## 🛡️ 5. Secure and Scoped Access to APIs

### Scenario

Your AI app needs to access internal APIs, but you want fine-grained control over what it can see or do.

### How MCP Helps

- Define capabilities as proxies to those APIs
- Add business logic, rate limits, validation
- Keep credentials out of the AI prompt context

---

## 🧪 6. Debugging and Log Search

### Scenario

A DevOps assistant helps engineers troubleshoot by querying logs or monitoring data.

### Capabilities

- searchLogs(service, keyword, dateRange)
- getDeploymentStatus(env)
- tailLogs(service)

### Benefits

- Reduces manual digging
- Empowers junior engineers with smart tools
- AI-driven observability

---

## 🔧 7. Dynamic App Configuration

### Scenario

An internal tool allows AI to fetch or suggest changes to app settings.

### Capabilities

- getFeatureFlagStatus(featureName)
- toggleFeatureFlag(featureName, value)
- getEnvironmentConfig(env)

---

## 🧠 TL;DR

| Use Case | Example Capability |
| --- | --- |
|Access knowledge base | getArticleByTitle(title) |
| Fetch order/invoice/shipping | getOrderStatus(orderId) |
| Trigger workflows | createSupportTicket() |
| Schedule meetings | bookMeeting(userId, time) |
| Secure internal API access | proxyInternalAPI() |
| Search logs/monitoring data | searchLogs(service) |
